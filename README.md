# React-and-Redux

## About

This is my personal Repository where I made projects using react and redux. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. (Not to be confused with a WordPress framework â€“ Redux Framework)

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
